# AndroidProjectBase
For working code that can be used as a base in android studio projects. Both Kotlin and .txt

The point of this repository is to hold working code that can be easily copy/pasted to an empty Android Studio project.
First creating an empty activity and then pasteing the needed parts of code to the activity.
This way you should not need to modify AndroidManifest.xml or edit packages.

At first this will only hold one example: "2 window navigation base" using navController and topAppBar icons to navigate.
